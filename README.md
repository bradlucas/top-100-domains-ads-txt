# top-100-domains-ads-txt

The files in this repo are the results of running a Adx.txt crawler on the top 100 programmatic domains.

The domain list is is available here [https://gist.github.com/bradlucas/f5060dfc602cfeedb140a23bb4d77403](https://gist.github.com/bradlucas/f5060dfc602cfeedb140a23bb4d77403).

The Adx.txt crawler is the latest version of [https://github.com/bradlucas/ads-txt-crawler](dhttps://github.com/bradlucas/ads-txt-crawler).
